# Encryptor App: Cipherator

It's an app that allows you to encrypt short text messages with simple ciphers. I use it to prepare field games for my friends.

## Available Ciphers

- Ceasar Cipher
- Switch Cipher

## Running the project on your local machine

Requirements: docker-compose installed

In the projects directory run `docker-compose up --build`. 

Then visit `localhost:8000` in your browser.

You should be able to see the project.

## Roadmap
The project is under constant development. In future, I plan to:

- implement decrypting mechanism
- add more ciphers

## Technologies used
- Flask
- Vue.js
- Tailwind CSS
