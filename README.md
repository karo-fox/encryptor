# Encryptor App: Cipherator

It's an app that allows you to encrypt short text messages with simple ciphers. I use it to prepare field games for my friends.

## :key: Available Ciphers

- Ceasar Cipher
- Switch Cipher
- Morse Code

## :rocket: Running the project locally with Docker
### Production mode
In the project directory, run `docker compose -f production.yml up --build`, then open `localhost:80` in your browser.

### Development mode
In the project directory, run `docker compose up --build`, then open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## :pushpin: Usage
Follow the instructions on the screen.

If you are not sure how a particular cipher works or what its settings are, click on the question mark symbol. You will be moved to the instructions section.

### Available settings
You can choose light or dark mode and select Polish or English language in the upper right corner.
